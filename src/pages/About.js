                I am a rising junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, double majoring in Computer Science and
                Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science. Currently, I'm involved as a Software
                Developer for BUILD UMass, where I use my software engineering skills for pro-bono app/web development
                and tech consulting for the Amherst community. I also serve as a Designer for the HackUMass Organizing
                Team, responsible for graphics design and production for the annual hackathon. I'm actively searching
                for Software Engineering and/or Web Development internships for Summer 2021!
